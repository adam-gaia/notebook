# Adam's Notebook

This([my](https://github.com/adam-gaia) public notebook, somewhere between a blog and brain dump.
This is mostly meant for my reference, but hopefully something here will help someone out one day.
Pull requests welcome, but since these are my personal notes it's not guaranteed I'll accept a PR.
