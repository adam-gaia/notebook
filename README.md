# Adam's Notebook

This([my](https://github.com/adam-gaia) public notebook, somewhere between a blog and brain dump.
This is mostly meant for my reference, but hopefully something here will help someone out one day.
The writings may be ramblely, incomplete or even factually wrong. Again, these are my informal, personal notes I take as I work.
Pull requests welcome, but it's not guaranteed I'll accept anything.
